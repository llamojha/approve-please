# Future Tasks

- Build a reusable engineer roster (persona traits, tone, quote banks) and wire PR authors/briefings to those personas so characters feel consistent across the game.
- Layer in NPC reactions: when you approve or reject a PR, its author posts a short in-character response, influenced by their current happiness.
- Track happiness/relationship meters per engineer that rise/fall with your decisions, impacting future dialog or PR quality when thresholds are crossed.
- Add richer visual feedback (color themes, micro-animations) for PR success/failure states so players instantly read whether a decision helped or hurt.
- Surface deploy post-mortems that explain which lines in an approved PR caused bugs, teaching players what to watch for next time.
- Implement a high-score / leaderboard view that persists top runs (stability, velocity, incidents, streaks) for replayability.
- Expand day structure into a Monday–Friday calendar with themed modifiers per day, plus an optional "overtime" phase after 17:00.
- Explore additional narrative hooks such as Slack-style banter or branching events triggered by very happy/unhappy engineers.
- Consider unlockable review tools (lint bot, diff filters) that cost budget but reduce workload, adding another strategic lever.
- Add PR arrival UX polish (e.g., swipe-in animation, motion blur, sound cue) so new requests feel like they’re physically sliding onto the desk instead of popping in.
- Introduce a queue-aging system where leaving PRs open drains Velocity/Satisfaction over time, with higher-priority PRs decaying meters faster to push timely reviews.
- Support carrying over unfinished PRs between days so anything left in the queue at 17:00 reappears during the next morning briefing instead of resetting.
- Add a visible "Restart Game" button on the summary/landing screens so players can quickly begin a fresh run without reloading the page.
