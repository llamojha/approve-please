# Future Tasks

- Surface deploy post-mortems that explain which lines in an approved PR caused bugs, teaching players what to watch for next time.

- Expand day structure into a Monday–Friday calendar with themed modifiers per day, plus an optional "overtime" phase after 17:00.

- Build a reusable engineer roster (persona traits, tone, quote banks) and wire PR authors/briefings to those personas so characters feel consistent across the game.
- Layer in NPC reactions: when you approve or reject a PR, its author posts a short in-character response, influenced by their current happiness.
- Track happiness/relationship meters per engineer that rise/fall with your decisions, impacting future dialog or PR quality when thresholds are crossed.

- Implement a high-score / leaderboard view that persists top runs (stability, velocity, incidents, streaks) for replayability.

- Explore additional narrative hooks such as Slack-style banter or branching events triggered by very happy/unhappy engineers.
